**Author:** Matt Elliott

**Due date:** Friday Feb. 19, 2016

## Description

Homework from the book, finding interest rates, seconds to years conversions, trigonometry equations

## What I Learned from This

I mostly learned how to clone files from github to edited. The reason this assignment is late is because I couldn't figure out how to submit it without the help of another student

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

Matt Elliott
